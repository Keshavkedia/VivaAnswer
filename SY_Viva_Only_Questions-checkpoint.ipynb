    "1. Answer the two questions below by 4:45 pm\n",
    "2. Upload your work to Github by 4:50 pm. No submissions uploaded after 4:40 pm will be reviewed.\n",
    "3. Invite the following collaborators to the Github Repo: jjadvani01, zoshuateaching, sheamehta, DishaVasa\n",
    "4. Submit a link to your Github repository on Google Classroom. \n",
    "5. Once completed, raise your hand on Zoom \n",
    "6. You will be sent to a breakout room for 5 minutes to explain your solution. Your TA will ask you to explain the code you have written. All you need to do is to explain what each line of code does. During the meeting, the TA will not tell you if you are correct or wrong. They will only take notes on your answers. \n",
